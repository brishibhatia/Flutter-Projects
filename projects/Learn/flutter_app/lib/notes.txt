Use Wrap widget instead of Row so that when the row elements start overflowing it will automatically shifted to next line.
Stateless widget is an abstract class and we just override its methods in the classes we extend
whenever we want to give decoration to listtile wrap in container and do all decoration in contaner itself.
SafeArea insets its child with padding to avoid operating system intrusions, using the greater of minimum or safe area padding.BUt to give full screen view we should avoid it.
Always write the name of the file in lowercase and the class name in camelcase
state -> over the override
Use valueNotifier and valuelistenablewidget for state varible accross the app(can be used in Stateless)
Either use nested valuelistenablewidget or ListenableBuilder with listenable.merge
Use ValueListenableBuilder → when you need the .value (like isDarkMode.value).AND Use ListenableBuilder → when you merge or listen to several notifiers (no direct .value).
A TextEditingController is a special controller class in Flutter used to:-> Read , Modify, or Listen to changes in the text inside a TextField or TextFormField.
arrow function is used if we have only one function to execute but if we have multiple (){},
If we use .adaptive with checkbox or CheckboxListtile then it will automatically adapt to the device UI
Use SingleChildScrollView which -> is a scrolling widget in Flutter that lets you make its child scrollable when the content overflows the screen.
If you want a nice ripple(splash) effect (Material look) → use InkWell. , If you need custom gesture control (like drag/swipe or non-Material look) → use GestureDetector
In Flutter, Navigator.push is used to navigate to a new screen (page) by adding a new route onto the navigation stack. The MaterialPageRoute widget defines how the new page transitions — providing a smooth material-style animation when moving between screens.
A Scaffold is typically used inside the new page to provide the basic visual structure like AppBar, Body, and FloatingActionButton.
Navigator.pushReplacement is similar to Navigator.push, but with one key difference:->It replaces the current screen with a new one, instead of stacking it on top.->That means when you navigate using pushReplacement,->the previous screen is removed from the navigation stack —>so the user can’t go back to it using the back button.
Use pushReplacement when:->You don’t want the user to go back (e.g., after login or splash screen).You’re moving between major app states (like “Login → Home”).
In a StatefulWidget, you access the data using the widget keyword: widget.username----widget.age
hero and cliRrect are used for annimation between the pages
Snackbar comes from ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar
if we want to make somethig constant and use it then declare it in a separate class like constant or global.dart with static specifier and access it anywhere with className.member
SharedPreferences in Flutter is a lightweight way to store small amounts of persistent data locally on a user’s device — such as settings, login state, user preferences, or any simple key–value data that should remain saved even after the app is closed or restarted.Refer SharedPreferences site
Use List.generate with column to generate a list of Widgets 
use  flutter_launcher_icons to replace the logo icon of the app
FractionallySizedBox is a layout widget in Flutter that sizes its child widget as a fraction of its parent’s size — both in width and height.--> It lets you specify how big a child should be relative to the available space of the parent.
For better results use layoutbuilder and FractionallySizedBox
In Dart, => is called the arrow syntax or fat arrow.It is a shorthand for returning a single expression
Dart’s switch expressions (introduced in newer versions like Dart 3) are expression-based rather than statement-based{
    final result = switch (number) {
  1 => 'One',
  2 => 'Two',
  _ => 'Unknown', // default case
};
}
